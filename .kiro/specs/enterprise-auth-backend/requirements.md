# Enterprise-Grade Authentication Backend - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a comprehensive, enterprise-grade authentication backend using Django. The system will serve as a centralized authentication hub capable of handling millions of users while maintaining sub-100ms response times. It will support OAuth2/OpenID Connect, multi-factor authentication, advanced session management, and seamless integration with any external system.

The authentication backend follows a monolithic architecture with Domain-Driven Design principles, leveraging Django's mature authentication framework while extending it with modern security features, horizontal scalability, and vendor-agnostic integration patterns.
